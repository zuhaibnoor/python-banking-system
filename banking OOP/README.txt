The classes.py file contains the backend of the project, all the python code for classes that are used at the frontend.
The RUN.py contains all the necessary functions to provide the user a smooth interface to interact with the program.
The admin.txt contains admin credentials.
	admin username: admin
	admin password: admin

The admin password should be handled carefully as it can never be changed without knowing the old admin password
The folder users contains the files for storing data of all the users.
The project uses an advance and extended library of tkinter i.e. customtkinter.
